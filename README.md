# Curve-X
**Curve-X is a small and easy-to-use C++ Bézier library to create 2D-splines with its own optional GUI editor.**

*If you are a game developer working on its own C++ engine and you want to have fine control over your values (let's say: gamepad sensitivity, dynamic FOV depending on the player's speed, gravity force, particle effects, animations, etc.) for the sake of game feel, this project may interests you.*

Curve-X allows to create 2D-splines, either they are intended to be geometrical shapes or for timed-based values. It is simple of usage yet allows a lot of manipulation. The code is also well-documented: each class, functions and enums are properly described.

By default, the project is built for C++17, yet it is compatible with the versions specified in [Dependencies](#dependencies).

This project is still under development, feel free to raise [issues](https://github.com/arkaht/cpp-curve-x/issues) as you encounter them.

## Dependencies 
+ C++11, 14, 17 or 20 compiler
+ CMake 3.11 is optional
+ *Nothing else...*

## Features
+ **Carefully well-documented code for classes, functions and enums**
+ Written in **simple and straightforward C++17** using **snake_case** notation
+ Project IDE-independent thanks to **CMake**
+ **Custom [GUI editor](https://github.com/arkaht/cpp-curve-editor-x) to easily create and edit curve files**
+ Support for both geometrical shapes and timed-based curves
+ Multiple evaluation methods: progress (from 0.0 to 1.0), time (using X-axis) and distance.
+ **Embedded curves serialization and un-serialization methods**
+ Custom and human-readable text format for curves serialization
+ **Free and open-source**

## Project Structure
This project is split into two Github repositories: the library (this one) and the [GUI editor application](https://github.com/arkaht/cpp-curve-editor-x). You are not forced to use the editor, it is entirely optional but it is here to facilitate your experience with Curve-X.

Folder structure:
+ `include/curve-x/` contains header files that you, as the library user, want to use inside your project. The most important one is `curve.h`, containing all required definitions to start using the library. If you want to have a deep-dive into the code, I'd recommend you to check the header files in this order: `point.h`, `utils.h`, `key.h`, `curve.h` and finally `curve-serializer.h`. 
+ `src/` contains source files and implementations of the header files located in the folder `include/curve-x/`.
+ `tests/` contains source files for testing and usage examples. You may want to look at it to better understand how to use the library. 
+ `samples/` contains samples of curve files generated by the library. You can import these inside the [GUI editor](https://github.com/arkaht/cpp-curve-editor-x) or in your code for testing. It's also here so you can get a grasp of what the text format is.

## Code Example
From [`tests/simple_example.cpp`](https://github.com/arkaht/cpp-curve-x/tree/master/tests/simple_example.cpp):
```cpp
//  Includes all necessary code including the Curve class
#include <curve-x/curve.h>
//  Includes the CurveSerializer class, only if you want to import or export
//  the curves data from or to files
#include <curve-x/curve-serializer.h>

//  Includes std::ofstream to output the curve data to files 
#include <fstream>

int main()
{
	//  Initialize a curve object
	curve_x::Curve curve;

	//  Add two keys with different control points
	curve.add_key( curve_x::CurveKey( { 0.0f, 0.0f } ) );
	curve.add_key( curve_x::CurveKey( { 1.0f, 1.0f } ) );

	//  Evaluate the curve at x=0.3f
	float time = 0.3f;
	float value = curve.evaluate_by_time( time );
	printf( "Evaluation for x=%f: y=%f\n\n", time, value );
	//  Output:
	//  Evaluation for x=0.300000: y=0.216000

	//  Serialize the curve into a string
	curve_x::CurveSerializer serializer;
	std::string data = serializer.serialize( curve );
	printf( "Curve serialized data:\n%s\n", data.c_str() );
	//  Output:
	//  version:1
	//	0:x=0.000000;y=0.000000,x=-1.000000;y=0.000000,x=1.000000;y=0.000000,0
	//	1:x=1.000000;y=1.000000,x=-1.000000;y=0.000000,x=1.000000;y=0.000000,0

	//  Write the serialized curve into a file
	std::ofstream file( "my_curve.cvx" );
	file << data;
	file.close();
}
```

For more examples, look at the [`tests/`](https://github.com/arkaht/cpp-curve-x/tree/master/tests) folder.

## Getting Started
This project is built using **CMake 3.11**. However, with proper setup it is not required to add it inside your projects.

### Add Curve-X to your project
#### With CMake
1. Clone Curve-X or [download the ZIP](https://github.com/arkaht/cpp-curve-x/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract it
2. Move the `curve-x` folder inside your project libraries folder, for example: 
```
<your_project>/
├── libs/
│   ├── curve-x/
│   │   ├── include/
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── ...
```
3. Optionally, delete folders that aren't required for your project such as `samples/` and `tests/`.
4. In `<your_project>/CMakeLists.txt`:
+ Use `add_subdirectory` with the library's path to include it:
```cmake
add_subdirectory("libs/curve-x")
```
+ Link the library to your project with `target_link_libraries`:
```cmake
target_link_libraries(<your_project_target> PRIVATE curve_x <your_project_libs>)
```
5. In your code, use the library, for example in `main.cpp`:
```cpp
#include <curve-x/curve.h>

// ...

int main()
{
	curve_x::Curve curve;

	// ...
}
```
6. Compile and run your project, you're ready to go!

## Why did I make it?
Originally, it was because I wanted time-based curves for my game engine so I could better control the feeling of my games, especially when I wanted to tweak each parameter of my explosion effects (i.e. transform scales and color lerps) with precise control and better visualization instead of having to hardcode them one by one.

I searched but couldn't find a C++ curve library that would suits my needs: a library easy-to-use, small to install and a GUI editor compatible with it.

Then, as I'm still a student, it also became a learning project to know more about curves.

It is also my first time using CMake and Git Submodules (used in the [editor repository](https://github.com/arkaht/cpp-curve-editor-x)).
